# Welcome to PyTorch Regression 🤖


PyTorch is a powerful tool for building artificial intelligence models. In this lecture, we'll explore regression analysis using PyTorch.


## What is Regression? 📊
Regression predicts outcomes based on information. It's like forecasting tomorrow's temperature.


### Regression in PyTorch 💻
We'll use PyTorch to build a regression model. This involves loading data, defining the model, training, and evaluating.


#### Loading Data 📁
We load the California Housing dataset and convert it into PyTorch tensors.


##### Defining the Model 📚
We define a simple regression model using PyTorch's neural network module.


###### Training the Model 🏋‍♂
We train the model using mean squared error and stochastic gradient descent.


###### Evaluating Performance 📊
We calculate the mean squared error on test data to check our model's accuracy.


###### Real-World Applications 🌎
Regression analysis is used in finance, economics, and data science.


###### PyTorch Advantages 💪
PyTorch offers flexibility, speed, and ease of use, making it perfect for beginners.
